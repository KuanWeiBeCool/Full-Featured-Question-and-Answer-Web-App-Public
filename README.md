This is a question and answer web app built using Django and hosted on Heroku. Here are some useful features:

- **Sign Up / Login:** you can sign up as a new user to access the full features of the web app. If you've already registered, simply sign in again! *Note: to avoid getting overcrowded on my database, the user information will be reset after the page is closed. Thus, you need to sign up again if you leave the page.*
- **Your profile page:** once you've signed in, you will have access to your profile page, where you can see all the posts you've created, change your username or password, or upload a new profile picture!
- **Make posts/comments/likes:** after you've login, you can create posts, add comments or likes in the community. 
- **Searching by keywords:** have something specific to know? You can search by keywards using the search bar on the top of the page.
- **Explore by categories:** a category filter can be applied to check the corresponding posts.
